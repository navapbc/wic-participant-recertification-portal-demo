# This script creates users in AWS Cognito and create database records for them in the participant database.
# It requires 2 positional arguments:
# - the environment to create the users in
# - the path to a json file that maps local agencies and emails (which are used as the username).
# See below for more details.
# Example: ./create-staff-users dev /tmp/email.json
# @TODO: This might possibly be better if the list of user_emails were pulled down from an S3 bucket.

# Positional arguments.
# The environment for the users to be created in.
ENV_NAME=$1

# The Cognito process needs a file with the emails for each local agency. This must be provided.
# Do not commit this file to git! Pass in the path to a file of the format:
# {
#   "user_emails": {
#     "<email>": "<local agency>"
# }
#
# For example:
# {
#   "user_emails": {
#     "apple@wic.gov": "gallatin",
#     "carrot@wic.gov": "gallatin",
#     "eggplant@wic.gov": "gallatin",
#     "banana@wic.gov": "missoula",
#     "daikon@wic.gov": "missoula",
