# Usage:
# This docker composition is meant to be invoked using the npm scripts in package.json.
# Run `npm run e2e` to create the database, then lowdefy, then run the playwright tests.
# Run `npm run e2e:cleanup` to clean up running and exited containers.
# Run `npm run e2e:update` to update the playwright linux snapshots.
#
# Advanced usage:
# Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to start up all the services
# Run `docker-compose exec playwright npx playwright test` to run tests
# Run `docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans` to cleanup
# Note: This usage *requires* running docker-compose down; otherwise containers are
#       will hang around forever. Not suitable for CI.
