# Index Page

The Index page is the landing page for the application.

## About This Page

This page contains static content about who is eligible to use this recertification portal.

## Considerations for Other States

We predict state agencies may make content and logo changes on this page
Also, state agencies would need to remove the portal survey, or replace it with a new survey

## Development

Remix allows us to use URL parameters in our paths, so the file on our filesystem is [app/routes/$localAgency/recertify/index.tsx](../../../participant/app/routes/%24localAgency/recertify/index.tsx)

The `$localAgency` parameter associates the participant's submission with a `LocalAgency` database record, using its `urlId` property.

Invalid `urlId` values will be redirected to the first database record in the `LocalAgency` table, and an empty `LocalAgency` table will result in an error.

The contents of this page are controlled by two things -

- The layout contained in [app/routes/$localAgency/recertify/index.tsx](../../../participant/app/routes/%24localAgency/recertify/index.tsx)
- The i18next strings for the `"Index"` key in [public/locales/en/common.json](../../../participant/public/locales/en/common.json)
