# Remix Stack

The Remix framework contains a feature called [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/stacks). This is essentially an application template that lets you quickly and easily build an application. For this project, we build the [Remix Shoegaze Stack](https://github.com/navapbc/remix-shoegaze-stack) that captures all of the features that we think a Remix-based project needs, including:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for storybook deploy, jest and playwright testing
- Database ORM with [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- Site-wide Internationalization support with [i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) and [remix-i18next](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-i18next)
- Static component and page stories with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- Styling with [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)
- End-to-end testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- Unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- Static Types with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

The Remix Shoegaze Stack is a skeleton, with some of the tricky parts of getting Jest, Playwright, Prisma, Storybook, and Remix to play together sorted out. Check it out if this looks like a helpful place to start a new project.
